The matter got so bad to the point where he completely lost the perception of reality. He began posting all kinds of Sora AI generated footage of popular figures committing a felony, and this resulted in the worldwide phenomenon of terrorist attacks and then some. Cocker got locked up in the most highly secured mental asylum in the world for his crime. What they didn’t know is that because of his departure from the reality, he and he plans to break out of there using his intellect he has developed over the years.
